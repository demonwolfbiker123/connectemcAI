# Admin Account Setup

## Default Admin Credentials

To create the default admin account:

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Click "Don't have an account? Sign up"
3. Register with these credentials:
   - **Email**: `admin@connectemc.ai`
   - **Password**: `123123`
4. The system will automatically assign admin role to this email address
5. You'll be redirected to the Admin Dashboard after registration

## How It Works

The database trigger automatically detects when `admin@connectemc.ai` registers and assigns the `admin` role. All other email addresses get the `user` role by default.

## Admin Features

Once logged in as admin, you can:
- Add, edit, and delete courses with knowledge base content
- View all user feedback with ratings
- Monitor complete chat history across all users
- Filter chat history by specific users

## User Registration

Any other email address will be registered as a regular user with access to:
- Browse and view courses
- Chat with AI assistant for each course
- Save helpful AI responses
- Submit feedback with ratings
- View saved content
